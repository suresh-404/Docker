# Docker Overview

Docker takes a **logistical approach** to solving common software problems and simplifies your experience with:

- Installing software  
- Running software  
- Publishing software  
- Removing software  

It’s a **command-line program**, an **engine background process**, and a **set of remote services**. It’s also integrated with community tools provided by **Docker Inc.**

## Core Concepts

- **Container Abstraction**  
  The container abstraction is at the core of Docker’s logistical approach.  
  Working with containers instead of software creates a **consistent interface** and enables the development of more sophisticated tools.

- **System Tidiness**  
  Containers help keep computers tidy because software inside containers can’t interact with anything outside them, and **no shared dependencies** can be formed.

- **Cross-Platform Support**  
  Since Docker is available and supported on **Linux, macOS, and Windows**, most software packaged in Docker images can run on **any computer**.

- **Simplicity Over Complexity**  
  Docker doesn’t invent container technology—it **hides the complexity** of working directly with container runtimes and turns **best practices into reasonable defaults**.

- **Ecosystem Integration**  
  Docker works within the broader **container ecosystem**, which is rich with tooling that solves new and higher-level problems.
